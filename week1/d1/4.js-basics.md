# JavaScript Basics

## Variables

- Think of a variable as a box that you can put one thing inside at a time.

```js
/**
 * The let for var keyword are used to create (define) a new variable.
 * Next comes what we want the variable to be named.
 * After the equal sign is the initial value to store in the variable.
 * Here we are storing multiple characters strung together (a string).
 */
let box = "hello";

/**
 * Print out the contents of our variable.
 */
console.log(box); // "hello"
/**
 * Notice we don't use the let keyword again b/c the var already exists.
 * Now since we use the equal sign on a variable that already exists, we are
 * re-assigning it. Replace the string that is in the box with the number 10.
 */
box = 10;
console.log(box); // 10
```

## Storing Multiple Items In A Variable

- Remember I said to think of a variable as a box that you can only put one thing in at a time?
- This is a little misleading but still true. You can store multiple items in a variable by putting them into an array or an object, which are collection data structures used to store multiple items. An array is just another word for a list, a shopping list is an array of strings (product names).
- Then you can put that array or object into your variable, but the variable still only has the one thing in it, the one array, but the array has multiple items.
- What if you want to put multiple arrays into a variable? You put one array into the variable where each item of the array is another array.

```js
box = [15, "hello"];
console.log(box); // box contains one thing, an array, but the array two items.
```

## Operators

- Operators are symbols that perform an operation, such as `=`, `+`, `-`, `*` (multiplication) and `/` (division). There are more symbols that are used for comparisons that we will cover shortly.

```js
let wallet = 20;

wallet = wallet - 10; // wallet = 20-10
console.log(wallet); // 10

wallet -= 10; // shorthand for wallet = wallet - 10
console.log(wallet); // 0
```

- `+` and `+=` work the same as `-` and `-=` except for addition but it behaves differently when used between non-numbers.

```js
let message = "hi";
message += 5;
console.log(message); // "hi5"

message = "hello";
message += " world";
console.log(message); // "hello world";

message = "10";
message += 5;
console.log(message); // "105"
message -= 5;

/**
 * This time it was able to interpret the math we wanted to do and so it
 * converted (coerced) our string "105" into the integer 105 so it could
 * subtract the integer 5 from it to give us the integer result of 100.
 *
 * This doesn't work the same as += when one of the operands is a string,
 * because it thinks you are trying to concatenate strings instead of doing
 * math.
 */
console.log(message); // 100 (not a string)
```

## Conditions & Comparisons

- A condition is just as it sounds, something that happens only when some conditions are met. Conditions are `if` statements that all boil down to `true` or `false`. `if` `true` then the condition happens, `if` `false` then the condition does not happen.

```js
let x = 20;
let y = 10;

// Compare x and y for equality. Evaluates to true or false.
if (x === y) {
  console.log("x equal to y");
}
// Compare which is larger. Evaluates to true or false.
else if (x > y) {
  console.log("x is greater than y");
}
// Since x is not equal to y, and x is not greater than y, it must be smaller.
else {
  console.log("x is smaller than y");
}

// Logical AND operator. Evaluates to a true or a false.
if (x > 5 && y > 5) {
  console.log("x AND y are both greater than 5");
} else {
  console.log("x, y, or both of them are not greater than 5.");
}

// Logical OR operator. Evaluates to a true or a false.
if (x > 5 || y > 5) {
  console.log("At least one of x or y are greater than 5, maybe both.");
} else {
  console.log("Neither x or y are greater than 5.");
}

if (x) {
  console.log(
    "x is 'truthy'. It is exactly true or true-ish. It is a non-empty value. It is not 0, not an empty string, not null, not undefined, etc."
  );
} else {
  console.log(
    "x is 'falsy'. It is exactly false or 'false-ish', such as 0, null, or an empty string."
  );
}
```

## Arrays

```js
// An array of strings.
let names = ["Rick", "Morty", "Jerry"];

// Execute the push method / function built-in to arrays to add an item.
names.push("Beth");

// Execute the pop method / function built-in to arrays to remove last item.
names.pop();

/**
 * Loop over the array to visit ever item, 1-by-1. This is just like what you
 * do when you literally read a list of names from start to finish 1-by-1.
 * You look at the first one, then the second, repeat until the end.
 *
 * Create a var called i to keep track of what index in the array we are
 * looking at. Repeat while i < the length of the array.
 * Increment i to the next index after each iteration of the loop.
 */
for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
  // Index the array to retrieve the item at the current index position.
  let currentName = names[i];

  console.log(currentName);
}

// The same thing written as a while loop instead of a for loop.
let idx = 0;

while (idx < names.length) {
  let currentName = names[i];
  console.log(currentName);
  idx++;
}
```
