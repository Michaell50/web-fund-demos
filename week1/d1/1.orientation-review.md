# Orientation Review

## Expectations

- There are requirements for graduation. If you fail to meet them you will not graduate and will have to retake part of the course, costing you more time and money.
- I expect you all to give this your best effort and to try to engage with your class mates and the lectures and assignments.
- Students who reach out for help will receive the most help, you are responsible for asking for help if you need it.
- You are expected to give assignments an honest effort before seeking TA and instructor help, this is how you learn to be self-sufficient, through practice. This is what the 20 minute rule is for; spend at least 20 minutes trying to solve your issue on your own before you reach out for help. However, don't spend hours stuck on a small issue without seeking help.

### Attitude

- "Nothing can help someone with the wrong mental attitude; but nothing can stop someone with the right mental attitude."
  - Except something that helps them realize they need to change their attitude.
- Be nice and respectful to each other, especially to people who have struggling to understand something; don't make it harder for them.
- Maintain a growth mindset. You can always improve and learn. Focus on improving from where you were yesterday, not in comparison to others you have a different history than you.
  - Every situation is an opportunity to learn. E.g., don't be frustrated that you have to google to find an answer, remind yourself this is an extremely valuable skill and that every time you practice it you are improving and becoming more valuable. Being frustrated is an opportunity to practice improving your emotional intelligence.

### Graduation Requirements

#### Attendance

- Greater Than 80% attendance
- Notifying me if you are going to be absent or late in a timely manner so you can be marked excused (direct message or email).

#### Assignments

- Greater Than 70% completion of required assignments.
- Skip all optional assignments unless you are ahead.

#### Belts & Projects (Exams)

- Do your best to be prepared to the take the exam on exam day. Don't disappear on exam day if it's not going well, communicate with me.
- No plagiarism (copy pasting small portions of code is fine).
- You need an exam belt in Web Fund, Python, and then belts OR projects for the remaining stacks.

#### Academic Probation

- If your attendance is lacking or you are falling too far behind on assignments, we will issue an academic probation warning, and then by the next check if the issue is not resolved, you will be placed on academic probation which could impact your ability to graduate if you do not become "in good standing" in future check ins.
- Even if you pass the belt exam, if you do not finish the section (stack) with the required attendance and assignment completion rates, you will have to repeat it before moving forward.

### Daily Surveys

- There are daily surveys that will pop up on the learning platform. You don't need to write any feedback if you don't want to.
- We read the feedback and have made changes based on _constructive feedback_.
- If you are going to write feedback, practice writing detailed **constructive feedback that is solution oriented**. This is an extremely valuable skill to get better at for work and life in general. Don't waste your time writing angry feedback that doesn't provide useful information.

### Help Each Other

- One of the most valuable part of this program is that you are in this together, you have a community, but you have to take advantage of the community and engage with it to get the benefit.
- Two the highest quality ways of learning are:
  1. Learning how to do something with someone else who is also trying to learn the same thing.
  2. Helping someone else learn something that you recently learned or know decently well.

### Discord

- Read the rules channel and follow the rules and familiarize yourself with how to use discord. There is an intro video linked in the server-info channel.

### Schedule Review

#### Track Progress / Turn In Assignments

- Track your progress on the Assignment Progress tab of the schedule and turn in your assignments on the Learn Platform.
- This is something devs generally have to do in the professional setting, you are assigned tasks (User Stories are new features and bugs are things to fix) and mark them completed once your code is finished.
